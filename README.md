# DownloadManager

## Project Description:
A Computer-Networks programming academic project. In this project I have implemented a download manager using multiple HTTP connections that supports multi-server download.

## Usage:
Simply run the command: java DownloadManager <url of file to download> <number of connections>

## Further Ideas:
- Implement UI other than the console
- Seperate UI from Backend
- Support multiple downloads of several files
